# Little Esty Shop Extension: Bulk Discounts 

By [Hady Matar](https://github.com/hadyematar23)

## Description of Project

This first part of this project was initially done as a [group project](https://github.com/hadyematar23/little-esty-shop) with several cohort members as a group project at Turing Backend Module 2 program. 

I chose to use the [default repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/little_esty_shop_bulk_discounts) provided by Turing as a starting point for this project so that I could get more experience working and building off of the work of others. 

This project works to create funcationality for a merchant to provide discounts to customers who purchase more than one of a single item. 

Stories 1-5 have basic CRUD functionality, including permitting the merchant to create a bulk discount, edit it, delete it, and view it both in index and show format. 

Stories 6-8 focus on active record and calculating the cost for an invoice as it relates to that merchant, with and without the bulk discounts. There is added functionality to calculate the cost of an invoice including bulk discounts for all merchants on the invoice (this can be accessed through the admin path). 

Story 9 focuses on consuming an API so that the merchant can see the upcoming national holidays in their country or operation. I chose to use Mexico and not the United States. 

Below is an outline of the schema as applied to this project.
